# Attachments & Storage

Den includes a built-in abstraction for attaching files to documents. The
metadata (path, mime, size, hash) lives on an embeddable struct in the
document; the actual bytes live behind a `den.Storage` interface that the
application configures once at `Open` time.

## When to Use It

- Blog engines uploading post covers and images
- CMS attachments on pages
- User-avatar uploads
- Any document type that owns a file

If you only need to store small inline payloads (JSON config blobs, small
snippets), just add a `string` or `[]byte` field. Attachments earn their
keep when the payload is bytes that belong on a CDN, a disk, or S3 — not
inside the document JSON.

## Enabling Attachments

Embed `document.Attachment` alongside `document.Base`:

```go
import "github.com/oliverandrich/den/document"

type Media struct {
    document.Base
    document.Attachment

    OriginalName string `json:"original_name" validate:"required,max=255"`
    AltText      string `json:"alt_text,omitempty"`
}
```

`Attachment` carries four fields, all validated via struct tags:

```go
type Attachment struct {
    StoragePath string `json:"storage_path"     validate:"required,max=1024"`
    Mime        string `json:"mime"             validate:"required,max=100"`
    Size        int64  `json:"size"             validate:"required,min=1"`
    SHA256      string `json:"sha256,omitempty" validate:"omitempty,len=64"`
}
```

These fields are set by the Storage when bytes are stored and are not meant
to be edited by application code afterwards — `StoragePath`, `Size`, and
`SHA256` are intrinsic to the stored content.

!!! note "StoragePath is an object key, not a URL"
    `StoragePath` is the path **relative to the storage backend's root** —
    for the `storage/file` backend that is the root directory, for S3 that is the
    object key inside the bucket. Hosts, bucket names, query strings, and
    pre-signed URL parameters do NOT belong here; they come out of
    `Storage.URL()` on demand. The 1024-byte limit matches S3 and GCS
    object-key maxima.

## IS-a-file vs. HAS-files

There are two common shapes:

**IS-a-file** — the document represents a single file. Embed the
`Attachment`:

```go
type Media struct {
    document.Base
    document.Attachment
    AltText string `json:"alt_text,omitempty"`
}
```

**HAS-files** — the document references one or more files. Use named
fields:

```go
type Product struct {
    document.Base
    Name      string              `json:"name"`
    Hero      document.Attachment `json:"hero"`
    Thumbnail document.Attachment `json:"thumbnail"`
}
```

Both shapes use the same `Attachment` struct. Den's hard-delete cascade
finds attachments in either position via reflection.

## Installing a Storage Backend

Storage is configured once, at `Open`, via `den.WithStorage`. Concrete
backends live in sub-packages of `den/storage` and register themselves
on import. Two construction styles work:

**Direct constructor** — import the backend package and call its
`New`:

```go
import (
    "github.com/oliverandrich/den"
    "github.com/oliverandrich/den/storage/file"
)

fs, err := file.New("./uploads", "/media")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

db, err := den.OpenURL(ctx, dsn, den.WithStorage(fs))
```

**DSN-based dispatch** — useful for configuration-driven setups where
the backend is chosen at runtime (for example Burrow's `--storage-dsn`
flag). Import the backend for its side effect so it registers its
scheme:

```go
import (
    "github.com/oliverandrich/den"
    "github.com/oliverandrich/den/storage"
    _ "github.com/oliverandrich/den/storage/file" // registers "file://"
)

fs, err := storage.OpenURL("file:///uploads", "/media")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

db, err := den.OpenURL(ctx, dsn, den.WithStorage(fs))
```

The `file://` DSN uses the same SQLAlchemy/JDBC-style convention as
`sqlite://`:

| DSN | Path handed to the filesystem |
|---|---|
| `file:///data/media` | `data/media` *(relative, 3 slashes)* |
| `file:////var/media` | `/var/media` *(absolute, 4 slashes)* |

One leading slash is stripped on parse so that standard URL libraries
(Go `net/url`, Python `urllib.parse`) can tokenise the DSN with the
authority component staying empty. Direct construction via `file.New(...)`
takes the filesystem path literally — no stripping.

One Storage serves every document type in the database. If you need
per-type routing (public CDN for post covers, private bucket for invoices),
that is an application concern — wrap your Storage with a dispatcher that
picks a backend based on the call site.

Without a Storage, `Store` / `Open` / `Delete` on attachments still work
because application code holds a reference to the Storage instance
directly. What breaks is the automatic hard-delete cascade, which only
runs if a Storage is installed on the DB.

## Uploading Bytes

Use `Storage.Store` directly — attachment upload happens in your HTTP
handler (or CLI importer), not inside Den:

```go
func uploadHandler(db *den.DB) http.HandlerFunc {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        f, header, err := r.FormFile("file")
        if err != nil { /* respond 400 */ return }
        defer f.Close()

        ext := filepath.Ext(header.Filename)
        mime := header.Header.Get("Content-Type")

        att, err := db.Storage().Store(r.Context(), f, ext, mime)
        if err != nil { /* respond 500 */ return }

        media := &Media{
            Attachment:   att,
            OriginalName: header.Filename,
        }
        if err := den.Insert(r.Context(), db, media); err != nil {
            // Clean up the stored bytes if the DB insert fails —
            // otherwise you have an orphan.
            _ = db.Storage().Delete(r.Context(), att)
            return
        }

        /* respond 201 with media */
    }
}
```

Two cleanup situations to keep in mind:

1. **Insert fails after Store succeeds** — application code must call
   `Storage.Delete` to avoid an orphan. Store-then-Insert is not atomic.
2. **Hard delete cascade** — Den handles this automatically: when
   `den.Delete(ctx, db, doc, den.HardDelete())` removes a document that
   contains attachments, Den calls `Storage.Delete` for each.

Failures during the cascade are logged via `slog.Warn` but do not fail
the database delete. A broken reference (DB points at missing bytes) is
worse than orphan bytes (recoverable via an offline sweep that
cross-references filesystem paths with `StoragePath` values).

## Reading Bytes

```go
f, err := db.Storage().Open(ctx, media.Attachment)
if err != nil { /* 404 */ return }
defer f.Close()

// Stream to HTTP response, copy to another storage, etc.
io.Copy(w, f)
```

## Serving URLs

`Storage.URL` returns the URL path at which the file is served. For
the filesystem backend that is the URL prefix passed at construction
plus the storage path:

```go
fs, _ := file.New("./uploads", "/media")
// Attachment.StoragePath = "2026/04/abc123def4567890.jpg"
fs.URL(att) // -> "/media/2026/04/abc123def4567890.jpg"
```

Remote storage backends may return absolute URLs (`https://cdn.example.com/...`)
or pre-signed URLs. Applications should treat the return value as opaque.

Serving the files is up to the application. The
[burrow/uploader](https://github.com/oliverandrich/burrow/tree/main/uploader)
package provides a ready-made HTTP serving handler and multipart ingress
helpers built on the `Storage` interface.

## Hard-Delete Cascade

When a document that contains attachments is hard-deleted, Den walks the
document via reflection, collects every non-zero `Attachment` it finds
(in embeds and in named fields), and calls `Storage.Delete` for each:

```go
// Bytes AND record are gone after this call.
err := den.Delete(ctx, db, media, den.HardDelete())
```

The walker only descends into struct fields and pointer-to-struct fields.
Slices and maps are not followed — if you need to clean up attachments in
a slice, use a `BeforeDeleter` hook:

```go
type Gallery struct {
    document.Base
    Items []document.Attachment `json:"items"`
}

func (g *Gallery) BeforeDelete(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Hard-delete cascade does not follow slices. Clean up by hand.
    storage := /* access via a closure or service locator */
    for _, a := range g.Items {
        if err := storage.Delete(ctx, a); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

Soft-delete does NOT trigger the cascade — the bytes stay until you
hard-delete. That matches the intent of soft delete (reversible removal).

## The File Reference Implementation

`den/storage/file` is the reference backend. It stores bytes on the
local disk under a configurable root directory, addressed by the
content hash:

```go
import "github.com/oliverandrich/den/storage/file"

fs, err := file.New("./uploads", "/media")
```

Importing the package for its side effect also registers the `file://`
scheme with [`storage.OpenURL`](#installing-a-storage-backend), so
configuration-driven setups can use either form interchangeably.

The generated path is
`YYYY/MM/<first-16-of-sha256>.<ext>` — grouped by month, content-addressed,
dedup-on-write. Two uploads of the same bytes in the same month resolve to
the same path; the second `Store` returns the existing path instead of
duplicating the file.

Security-relevant behavior:

- **Path traversal is refused** — `Open` and `Delete` use `os.Root` (Go
  1.24+). A `StoragePath` that escapes the root (via `..` or symlinks)
  cannot read anything outside the configured directory.
- **Empty uploads are rejected** — `Store` on a zero-byte reader returns
  `storage.ErrEmptyContent`.
- **Delete is idempotent** — a missing path returns success, simplifying
  cleanup orchestration against the document lifecycle.

### URL-prefix accessor

The filesystem backend exposes its HTTP prefix via `URLPrefix() string`:

```go
fs, _ := file.New("./uploads", "/media")
fs.URLPrefix() // "/media"
```

HTTP-layer packages (`burrow/uploader`, custom handlers) use this to
mount a serving handler on the same route that `URL` produces, without
having the prefix configured twice. Remote backends (S3, GCS)
intentionally do NOT implement this method — the absent `URLPrefix()`
is the signal that the Storage is responsible for serving and the HTTP
package should skip local routing.

## Writing a Custom Storage Backend

Implement `den.Storage`:

```go
type Storage interface {
    Store(ctx context.Context, r io.Reader, ext, mime string) (document.Attachment, error)
    Open(ctx context.Context, a document.Attachment) (io.ReadCloser, error)
    Delete(ctx context.Context, a document.Attachment) error
    URL(a document.Attachment) string
}
```

Requirements implementations MUST honour:

- **Content-addressed** — two `Store` calls with identical bytes must
  resolve to the same `StoragePath`. Den relies on this for dedup.
- **Idempotent Delete** — a missing path is not an error.
- **Concurrency-safe** — `Store` / `Open` / `Delete` / `URL` must be
  callable from multiple goroutines.
- **Fill in SHA256** — the returned Attachment's `SHA256` should be the
  full hex-encoded SHA-256 of the stored bytes. Several Den features rely
  on the hash for diff detection.

Optional method:

- **`URLPrefix() string`** — implement only when `URL` returns a path
  relative to the current HTTP server (i.e. the application is expected
  to serve the bytes itself). HTTP-layer packages (`burrow/uploader`)
  type-assert on a local `interface { URLPrefix() string }` to decide
  whether to mount a serving handler and at what route. Backends that
  return absolute URLs (S3, GCS, a CDN) should omit the method — its
  absence signals "I serve myself, do not register a local handler".

## Uniqueness Trade-off

`document.Attachment` deliberately does NOT carry a `den:"unique"` tag on
`StoragePath`. The reason: a `Product.Hero` attachment that references the
same bytes as another `Product.Hero` is a legitimate case — two products
can share a hero image via content addressing. A unique constraint on
`storage_path` at the collection level would forbid that.

For "library" collections where each file must map to one record (a media
library: one record per file), either add your own unique constraint in
application logic (look up by SHA256 before insert) or lean on the
content-addressed Storage's dedup — identical bytes produce the same
`StoragePath`, and the database insert will fail if your collection has a
unique index on that field.
